## MSN Video Replaces FeedRoom.com

This just in: I have always disliked the aggressive commercialism at the FeedRoom.com. I categorize their video-based news under ‘News for Corporations’ to distinguish it from ‘News for Human Beings.’ So when I stumbled upon [video.msn.com](http://video.msn.com/) I immediately found a replacement for my corporate news category.

The number one feature of [video.msn.com](http://video.msn.com/) is the play list—the commercial-free play list. I’m sold. For people who want “serious” video news with that UN-centric bent, check out [Reuters Television](http://tv.reuters.com/). When you are ready to take your first baby steps off the animal farm, you’ll need Amy Goodman’s [Democracy Now!](http://democracynow.org/) For your video news in our ‘News for Human Beings’ category.

I recognize [Dare Obasanjo](http://blogs.msdn.com/dareobasanjo/) for prompting me to explore <acronym title="Microsoft Network">MSN</acronym> with a renewed interest. They are still trying and I am beginning to see improvement.
