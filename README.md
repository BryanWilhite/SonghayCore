# SonghayCore

[![Build Status](https://songhay.visualstudio.com/SonghaySystem/_apis/build/status/songhay-core-yaml-build?branchName=master)](https://songhay.visualstudio.com/SonghaySystem/_build/latest?definitionId=16&branchName=master)

Here is the _Core_ code to install as [a NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SonghayCore/) for all of my studio Solutions. Anyone who may be reading this üëÄ is free to do the same. This package is based on `net8.0`.

**NuGet package üì¶:** [`SonghayCore`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SonghayCore/)

**documentation üìö:** [`SonghayCore` API](https://bryanwilhite.github.io/SonghayCore/)

## _core_ reusable, opinionated concerns

### `Songhay.Hosting`

One of the most important additions to .NET came in .NET 6.0 (circa 2021): the _.NET Generic Host_ [üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/generic-host)]. This _host_ concept from Microsoft allows developers to _not_ have to reinvent:

- Dependency injection (DI)
- Logging
- Configuration
- App shutdown
- `IHostedService` implementations (for long-running background tasks \[üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/timer-service?pivots=dotnet-7-0) \])

All ASP.NET developers expect to get these things ‚Äúfor free‚Äù and, finally, Microsoft is basically letting all .NET developers get these things for free. This _Core_ recognizes the _.NET Generic Host_, stating with the `DefaultHostedService` [class](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Hosting/DefaultHostedService.cs) (see `Songhay.Extensions` below for more details).

### `Songhay.Diagnostics`

This _Core_ is concerned with _tracing_ as well as logging. Logging concerns should be logically above this _Core_. [`TraceSources`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Diagnostics/TraceSources.cs) and [`TraceSourceExtensions`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Extensions/TraceSourceExtensions.cs) define how tracing should be implemented with a bias toward using all source levels. When tracing is not configured for this _Core_ then it will be ignored without throwing exceptions.

For a review of the organizational difference between tracing and logging, see ‚Äú[Tracing vs Logging vs Monitoring: What‚Äôs the Difference?](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/monitoring-logging-tracing/)‚Äù by [Chrissy Kidd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrissy-k-47294593).

**Documentation üìö:** [`Songhay.Diagnostics`](https://bryanwilhite.github.io/SonghayCore/latest/Songhay.Diagnostics/)

### `Songhay.Extensions`

The Songhay System uses imperative C# code with a view to make it more functional in an effort to control complexity and enhance maintainability.

The preference for [extension methods](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/tree/master/SonghayCore/Extensions) encourages stateless, reusable routines (many of them are ‚Äúpure‚Äù functions).

Notable extensions:

- [`IConfigurationExtensions`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Extensions/IConfigurationExtensions.cs) ‚Äî defines shared routines based on conventions around the _.NET Generic Host_ [üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/generic-host)].

- [`IConfigurationBuilderExtensions`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Extensions/IConfigurationBuilderExtensions.cs) ‚Äî defines shared routines for application configuration building under .NET Standard.

- [`ILoggerExtensions`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Extensions/ILoggerExtensions.cs) ‚Äî defines shared routines based on conventions around the _.NET Generic Host_ [üìñ [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/generic-host)].

- [`HttpRequestMessageExtensions`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Extensions/HttpRequestMessageExtensions.cs) ‚Äî defines shared routines for HTTP access under .NET Standard with a lazy-loaded `HttpClient`. Routines for Azure Blob Storage are included here.

- [`HttpWebRequestExtensions`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Extensions/HttpWebRequestExtensions.cs) ‚Äî defines shared routines for HTTP access for the legacy .NET Framework.

There is support for [URI templates](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) (to be used with [`RestApiMetadata`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Models/RestApiMetadata.cs)) in the form of [extension methods](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Extensions/RestApiMetadataExtensions.Tavis.cs), running on top of [`Tavis.UriTemplates`](https://github.com/tavis-software/Tavis.UriTemplates).

**Documentation üìö:** [`Songhay.Extensions`](https://bryanwilhite.github.io/SonghayCore/latest/Songhay.Extensions/)

### `Songhay.Models`

The _Core_ models of the Songhay System define types for MIME, XHTML, OPML, REST, the Repository, the Display Item (for WPF and other MVVM solutions), etc.

The _Core_ models are ‚Äúanemic‚Äù by design (there are very few abstract classes)‚Äîany logic would be found _first_ in an Extension Method.

Notable models:

- [`DisplayItemModel`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Models/DisplayItemModel.cs) ‚Äî defines the conventional way to display data.

- [`MenuDisplayItemModel`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Models/MenuDisplayItemModel.cs) ‚Äî defines the conventional way to display nested/grouped data.

- [`RestApiMetadata`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Models/RestApiMetadata.cs) ‚Äî defines conventional REST API metadata.

**Documentation üìö:** [`Songhay.Models`](https://bryanwilhite.github.io/SonghayCore/latest/Songhay.Models/)

### `Songhay.Xml`

The ‚Äúcore‚Äù of the _Core_ is concern for XML. The Songhay System started out as utilities around [`XPathDocument`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xpath.xpathdocument(v=vs.110).aspx) and grew into LINQ for XML‚Äîover [`XDocument`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.linq.xdocument(v=vs.110).aspx).

## fundamental boundary-crossing abstractions

This _Core_ features the ‚Äòboundary-crossing abstractions‚Äô (and default implementations) needed for the enterprise work based on my historical needs:

- [`IApiEndpoint`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Abstractions/IApiEndpoint.cs) ‚Äî defines the conventional way to access distributed data (default implementation: [`ApiEndpoint`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Net/ApiEndpoint.cs)).
- [`IApiRequestStrategy`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Abstractions/IApiRequestStrategy.cs) ‚Äî defines the conventional way to request data from an endpoint (default implementations: [`ApiRequestStrategy`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Net/ApiRequestStrategy.cs) and [`AzureBlobApiRequestStrategy`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Net/AzureBlobApiRequestStrategy.cs)).
- [`IBlobStreamApiEndpoint`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Abstractions/IBlobStreamApiEndpoint.cs) ‚Äî defines the conventional way to request BLOB data from an endpoint (default implementation: [`BlobStreamApiEndpoint`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Net/BlobStreamApiEndpoint.cs)).

Dependency-injecting these ‚Äòboundary-crossing abstractions‚Äô are far more mockable than, say, using `HttpRequestMessage` directly.

## the _core_ Activity concept

This _Core_ features the concept of the Activity which is a way to formally recognize that all line of business applications can be thought of as a ‚Äòtree‚Äô of inputs and outputs. It follows that each ‚Äònode‚Äô of this ‚Äòtree‚Äô can be called an Activity. The following abstractions classify the Activities needed so far:

- [`IActivity`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Abstractions/IActivity.cs) ‚Äî defines the conventional, synchronous, input-output Activities
- [`IActivityOutputOnly`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Abstractions/IActivityOutputOnly.cs) ‚Äî defines the conventional, synchronous Activities with output only (input usually comes from `IConfiguration` in this case)
- [`IActivityOutputOnlyTask`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Abstractions/IActivityOutputOnlyTask.cs) ‚Äî defines the conventional, asynchronous Activities with output only (input usually comes from `IConfiguration` in this case)
- [`IActivityTask`](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/blob/master/SonghayCore/Abstractions/IActivityTask.cs) ‚Äî defines the conventional, asynchronous, input-output Activities

This Activity concept which I regard as _fundamental_ is the least likely architectural reality that would be shared by my peers üòê From the Microsoft point of view, my Activity concept would be buried under [Windows Workflow Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Workflow_Foundation) or [BizTalk Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_BizTalk_Server).
